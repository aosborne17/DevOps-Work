Had a few blockers with pushing to github, I think this was because i created\
a read me file directly on github instead of pushing\
this was overcome by pulling from github and then pushing\
everything together.


Day 3 Python Basics\
Using double quotes is better when using strings\
as it helps us to cancel out apostrophe's and other\
grammar that would otherwise confuse the interpreter\
if we used single quotes\

Naming conventions in Python

We should never name a variable with capitals and when writing two words\
connect them using an underscore to make it more readable.\

Note that unlike SQL, Python indexing begins from 0, empty spaces within a\
string is also counted

The strip method removes the space at the end of a string

Data collection

Why do we use lists?

Lists are mutable so we can add, remove and modify data inside of them
Lists are ordered, maknig it easier to access data

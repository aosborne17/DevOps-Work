Docker is a containerisation platform and can easily operate with any OS.
talking to each other through rest-api's

It creates containers, networks and host images

- Docker images are much smaller than VMs
Easily adopted and configured
much quicker to start up

## Why Docker

We ask docker to pull an image for us, the request will then go to docker host
and look for the image, if it can't find it will go do a registry to find it,
this is all done in seconds

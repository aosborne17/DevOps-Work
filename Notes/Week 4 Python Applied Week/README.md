Stands for Text Driven Development
a software development process that relies on the repetition 
of a very short development cycle. The equirements are turned into 
very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.

Working with files - excel - CSV - txt
SQL with python, db connectivity and querying, storing and fetching data

What comes before the interview?

The CV is the employers first overview of ourselves so it is important that this is made to the best of our ability.

In our CV we should highlight the skills that would make us a good fit for that specific job role. Keep the CV concise, employers get a lot of CVs so ours has to be eye catching from the get go. (how working at sainsbury’s helped my organisational techniques.

Make sure I add all the things I learn in the academy and other tech skills I have picked up in my self teaching


How should we prepare for interviews?

Think of questions that you may be asked and try to create model answers.
Gather information on the company.
Prepare Six Questions for the interviewer
Think of questions to ask them so I can learn more about the company, also shows that I am interested in the company.
What project would I expect to be working on?
Will I be working with a large team?
Where will I fit within the team?
What does a typical day look for a DevOps engineer like at your company?
What tech stack will I be working with at the company? (This will allow me to know what I need to study in more detail)
What sort of challenges are expected during projects?
What kind of team building activities do you carry out here?









How would you answer questions at an interview?

Use STAR technique, which stands for situation, task action and result:

Set the scene, talk about the situation.
Then describe the purpose of the task.
We then explain what we did, the actions that were carried out.
Lastly we explain the result that we received, what was the outcome and why this has made us better.

Always think from the interviewers point of view, what are they looking for when you answer the question. 
Employers want to know what you are bringing to the table, using STAR allows us to explain this well.

When they ask about a weakness, make sure to put a positive spin on it so I can show that I am working on that weakness and trying to better myself.

If asked about my customer service job, talk about the things I did in that role that can be transferable to the role I am being interviewed for.

Creating an elevator pitch (5 minute pitch)


Hi My name is Andrew and I am a recent university graduate and now aiming to transition my skills into the technology industry. I am currently doing a DevOps course with Sparta Global as a trainee where until now I have learnt the importance of communication skills and the importance of things such as Listening. These skills that I have learnt have enabled me to take clients' needs on board in an effective manner to be able to produce the best projects possible. So far in this course I have touched on aspects such as Git, GitHub and Pycharm, while being able to create links between remote consoles and the cloud.
Additionally I have touched on aspects such as python and SQL while being able to create small projects. My self taught studies show that I have the determination to bring onboard to any team that I find myself in. 
(Talk about some personal experiences/achievements that can be added to show what more I can bring to the company)



Things not to say in an interview

Don’t give yes/no answers, try to answer the question with greater depth and try to tell the interviewer about yourself as much as you can.

Don’t tell the client “I would rather do this” or “I don’t want to relocate here”, just be flexible to any opportunity that is proposed to me, to show that I am passionate about the opportunity.


Make sure I seem to be able to handle challenging situations, how I am able to overcome them. 
Show how I am able to save problems effectively, being able to attack problems from many different angels whilst keeping positive and not giving up.



Presentation Skills

Why would you need to create a presentation?

Deliver information to stakeholders, potentially crying to make the information more digestible.

Qualities that make a good presenter
Polite and greet everybody
Try to be clear, loud and do not speak too fast, show passion when you speak.
Body language is important, stand tall and don’t look at the floor or have your back to the audience, look the audience in the eye and have your hands by your side or use it to point to certain points.
Make sure we look confident, we do not need to read the slide. Confidence will come from being well versed in the topic.
Understand the room, if you are presenting to a business department they may not understand the jargon that you commonly use.
Don’t have too much text on the screen, it looks boring. Instead have clear bullet points summing up what you want to say and then expand on that


  
If asked a question that we do not have the answer for, simply say:
I am not 100% certain, I will find an answer and get back to you.

Don’t use bullet point warping

Summary


The Project Environment

Project vs BAU

 BAU = business as usual

BAU is the normal execution of  standard operations within an organisation.
BAU is very non - complex e.g. we work 9-5 everyday

A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome, we would be given a timeframe to carry out said project.

Once the project has been closed we se
Project is usually something done within a time frame, small changes made to do something; temporary change.

Lifecycle of a project

Initiation
Planning …. (how will control it, how are they key members), We spend alot of time in planning projects
Executing
Monitoring and controlling (if something goes wrong,
Closing (we can't close the project until we have full control)



The Triple Constraints of projects

If you have more time, it is likely the quality would be better as you can improve the quality further in that additional time.

Spending more money would in turn lead to greater quality. It is important to find a balance between these three parameters.



Microservice architecture is better than monolithic architecture as if something goes down you can focus only on that part

Auto scaling = When one database goes down some organisations may have backup databases to keep the company running.

Another one is called HA (high availability), you have cloud space available in different areas in the world.


The POPIT model

Process, Organisation, People, Information, technology

Benefits of managing a project well

Delegating task, giving certain tasks to those that are best suited for it
Instead of trying everything yourself, spread the workload for more efficiency.

Software Development Lifecycles

Three Main Methodologies:

Waterfall
V-Model
Agile

Currently Agile is the most used methodology due to the ability to constantly iterate new changes.
V - Model
Verification Process
Confirm that the systems fulfil the design requirements. 	
It is a measure of build.
 
Validation Process
Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs 	
It is a measure of performance.

Project managers are not well versed in code so we would usually begin to write up pseudocode to show to the PM’s before we begin to start coding.



When companies release softwares, any bugs found by the users would be reported back to the company; essentially the users are doing part of the testing for the company.

When somebody gives us a project, we MUST PLAN. If we do not plan and we realise we did something incorrectly I will take more time and potentially higher costs associated with the project.

PLAN, DO, CHECK (design, code, test), this is agile.




Devops' role in agile is about implementing the code, working with different departments to make sure the code is working correctly. As a devops engineer we interact with all departments to deliver the final code.
What is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is a person who can affect or be affected by a given project.

One way of determining stakeholders is to identify those who are directly impacted by the project and those who may be indirectly affected.
 
Examples of directly impacted stakeholders are project team members or a customer.

Being indirectly affected would be another organisation that may
It is important to understand that not all stakeholders will have the same influence or effect on a project, nor will they be affected in the same manner.



Stakeholders can be divided into being either Internal or External:


Network Diagrams
Network diagrams provide a visual representation of the project workflow

Gantt charts = Simply put, a Gantt chart is a visual view of tasks scheduled over time.

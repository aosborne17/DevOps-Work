### What are the three Amigos in agile

A meeting between the following:

- Business Analyst
- Developer
- Tester

- The purpose here is for everyone to come to a common understanding of how the
production will take place

#### What is a User Story

- A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

#### What is an Epic Story

- A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller 'user stories' which
can then be worked on easier

### Starfish Retrospective

- The goal of this retrospective is to look at the current practices being carried
out and deciding which needs more energy and which needs less directed to them

- This can be divided into things to keep doing, things to do less, things to stop
doing and lastly things to implement


### Root Cause Analysis

- This a methodology used for analysing problems in order to identify the root cause

- When we come across an issue we usually give a temporary solution. This is a problem because it means the same problem would resurface

- To tackle this, we will constantly ask questions as to why these problems are occurring to reach the root cause.

#### Information Radiators

- This a generic term for pieces of information that is highly visibly displayed in
the workplace
- This conveys the message that the company have nothing to hide from stakeholders
or from themselves

#### Four Agile Values

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working Software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
- Responding To Change Over Following A Plan


### Scrum Artefacts

#### Product backlog

#### Sprint Backlog

#### Product Increment

##### Definition Of Done

- This is defined upfront before product development begins, all team members must have
a sg

#### Acceptance Criteria

- This is specific to one feature and changes can be decided upon during development,
 this could be due to customer feedback

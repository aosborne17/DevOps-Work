DevOps Day 5

Daily Stand-up today going over what we did yesterday as well as going over the homework, updating it to the trello board.
Network Diagram, Talk with Phil, 

A planning technique: Network Diagram, working in teams, technical analysis and stakeholders.

How to create a well thought plan

Task Breakdown
Estimation of durations
Understanding logical dependencies
Create Network Diagram
Gantt chart

Network diagram is made based on the logical dependencies necessary to complete the task.
Different tasks will take different amounts of time. You should keep a couple days buffer. If anything goes wrong you have some wiggle room to work around the issue and still be on track.



Tasks that rely on each other to be able to be completed, is what is described as logical dependencies.

This shows that in order to be able to complete task D, I need to complete it’s predecessor which is task C. However to complete task C I need to complete it’s predecessor task A. This shows us that task A is our first task.


The network diagram allows us to see the logical order of activities and define our critical path.
It is always good practice to add a 0th node to add before the first step.

Activity on Node (AoN)
Earliest start
Latest Start
Float
Duration

These help us calculate the duration of our project.
Latest start is the latest time that the task should be started before it goes over the buffer
The float is the (latest start - earliest start), the difference between the two. 








Calculate Earliest start


Early start (es) we calculate left to right and Latest start (ls)we calculate right to left.

The earliest start of the predecessor node (A) + the duration of the predecessor node (A) would give the Early start of that node (B).

Latest start of present node - predecessor duration of the predecessor node, gives us the latest start of the predecessor node.

















Calculating Latest Start

Latest start of A would be the latest start of B minus the duration of A, so 30 - 10 would mean the latest start of A is 20.

With the last node the earliest and latest start would be the same.




















The critical path is the longest path, the length is measured by the time taken and not the number of nodes.
The top path is the critical path, as B + E = 35 (duration) but C + D = 25 (duration)











Having been given the durations of the tasks, we have to work out the earliest start, latest start and float of all the tasks in the diagrams. After having completed the diagram we can work out the critical, longest path

Longest path:

Critical Path: The longest path through the network diagram which has zero float 


•In case of multiple incoming paths, use the MINIMUM value

Working in teams

Tasks can be completed quicker when working in a team.

Attributes of Mature Teams
Co-located
Cross functional Roles (Devops is a bridge between Dev and Org teams so we are cross functional)
Self-Organising (who is going to do what)
Accountable and Empowered 
Test and Learn Feedback Loops (related to agile, taking small steps and learning from it)

QA = Quality Assurance (software testers)
BA = Business Analyst
PM = Project Management
DEV = Development
UX = User Experience (interface for the front end)


How to make projects easier
Positive environment
Communicate openly
Respect and Trust one another

















Examples of Techniques for Analysis


HOMEWORK OVER THE WEEKEND!!






Return on Investment (ROI)

Nobody wants to invest in the product if they do not believe they will make a profit  from that investment.

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why.



The investors will begin to get their money back for year 4. Here there the cashflow turns to positive (£10,000).


ANOTHER PIECE OF HW!!


What is a Risk?

The situation involving the possible 

Why is identifying risk as early as possible important?
We can think of ways to minimise or completely eliminate the risk.



Ways to identify risks.

Previous experience: If a company has experienced a risk before they would be better prepared against it next time.

Expected risks should be identified and protected.
Unforeseen risks is not anyone’s faults as these things could not have been prepared for


Dealing with Risk

Avoidance
Transfer (e.g. putting your secure data on AWS)
Reduce
Accept
Share 



Stakeholders

Stakeholder Attitudes
Champion (Work as an aid to the project)
Blocker (Those that block project progress, could be someone that does not agree with the new features that are set to be released)
Critic
Supporter
Opponent
Neutral (Whether the project goes ahead or not they are not too bothered… government?)

Planning involves setting out the roadmap for the project

Project planning
Resource Plan
Financial Plan
Quality Plan
Acceptance Plan
Communications Plan

Difference people from different streams of the platform would all need an effective communication plan e..

WORK-LIFE BALANCE

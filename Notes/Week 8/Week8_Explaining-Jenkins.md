# Jenkins

## What is Jenkins?

- Put simply, Jenkins is an open source automation server
- Jenkins is used to build and test software projects continuously, this makes it easier for developers to integrate code
as changes are made through small incremental steps
- If any errors are found when Jenkins tries to build our project, the build will fail and the developer would be
altered immediately
- If the build is successful, the project can be placed in the Delivery Phase

- As default Jenkins comes with limited features however it has over 1000 plugins, version controls such as git as well
as integration tools like Maven must be installed to use

## Why use Jenkins?
- Easy to detect bugs as tests are run after each commit
- Automated testing and building means more time can be spent on improving the software quality
- Automated processes also mean companies can be more reactive to customer feedback, increase customer satisfaction

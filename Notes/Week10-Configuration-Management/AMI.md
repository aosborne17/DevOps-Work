## Even when we stop our EC2 instance from running there is still some additional
## costs to it, therefore we can turn our EC2 into AMI's which we can start up whenever we want

## We are basically saving our EC2 instance

## AMI's are blueprints, when we click on one on AWS it will create the EC2 instance
##for us using the AMI image

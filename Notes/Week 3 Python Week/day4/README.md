Another day, another dollar.

Motivating yourself when learning technical topics.

Did we learn to walk in 5 minutes? a day? a month?
First you crawl, you stand up, your parents slowly support you with one hand,
after somme time when you develop balance you begin to learn to walk.

After time you learn to be able to run, and after some time you can then teach others.

Let these technical topics absorb, it will take some time

### Abstraction
```bash
when using methonds in our code

def bark(self)
        return "woof"

```



### Inheritance

```
class Animal

class Snake(Animal)
    def __init__(self)
        super().__init__()
        
        
```
This subclass inherits everything from the subclass


## Polymorphism 

We can inherit as well as override particular attributes\
without effecting the parent class

## Encapsulation

Making variables or methods private to hide various aspects\
of the class from a user

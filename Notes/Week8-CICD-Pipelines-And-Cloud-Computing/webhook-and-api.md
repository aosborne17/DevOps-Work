# Webhooks And API's

## What is a webhook

A webhook is a way for an application to provide other application with real-time information, delivering data to other
apps as it happens
Also referred to as reverse APIs, with most API's there's a request followed by a response however no requests are
required with webhooks and instead the data is just sent when available

An API would be calling someone every 5 minutes to ask them something, however a webhook would be more like waiting until
the person calls you, as you can see no request was required here

## What is an API

API stands for Application Programming Interface,they allow apps to communicate with each other

- This is where a call is made to a server using an API, information is sent out and then processed back to you

- Agile is a methodology that helps to create Continuous integration of the development and testing of a product by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts

- Agile encourages transparency and constant communication between internal teams, stakeholders and customers

- The aim of agile is to create products that fit the customers demand, this is usually executed through the creation of user stories

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

## What is Scrum

- Scrum is a framework that allows for the implementation of Agile, it allows for incremental builds to be delivered to the customer every so often through the implementation of sprints.
- Having worked in both Agile and Scrum environments, I like using Scum within the Agile framework to work closely with teams to achieve release goals.


## What are the scrum artefacts

#### Product backlog

- These are all the steps that must be achieved to complete the product and meet the DoD, it is maintained by the product owner

#### Sprint backlog

- These are all the completed steps that have been done

## What are the scrum events

##### Sprint Planning

- Meeting before the sprint where the team decides which steps from the product backlog they aim to work on for the upcoming sprint



##### Daily Stand up/scrum

- A 10 minute time boxed meeting where the dev team would talk about any advances made or any blockers that need to be overcome and what everyone will work on in the coming 24hrs, increasing transparency

##### Sprint

- This refers to the time period in which the team is working on the steps in the sprint backlog, sprints cannot last over 4 weeks

##### Sprint Review

- At the end of the sprint, the team presents the new features added to the software and receives feedback from the product owner and customers

- This helps to create a plan on whether the acceptance criteria may be altered based on the feedback given, the team must be flexible

##### Sprint Retrospective

- An internal meeting with only the dev team where they discuss the sprint and how to implement changes to improve the following sprint

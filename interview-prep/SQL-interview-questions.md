# SQL

## What is SQL?

- SQL is an abbreviation of structured query language, which allows for the creation and manipulation of databases.
- In my time using SQL I have done both of these things to varying degrees of complexities with the most challenging queries I have written
being analysis of data across multiple relational databases where an example of question I had to answer being: the
average time taken for orders to be shipped per company.
- This kind of query requires multiple joins and group by functions, as well as extracting dates and performing functions on these dates such as calculating the difference between
two dates, this data was then visualized both through excel as well as numpy and pandas which are python modules




## What is a constraint in SQL

-  These are specified rules for the data in our table, limiting the data than can go into our table
- They can be column level or table level


## What is null
- NULL is an undefined Value
- Doesn't mean it's equal to zero, it just holds no value and so nothing can be
equal to NULL


## What is a primary key in SQL

- A primary key is a constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a
table
- A table can only have one primary key


## What is a foreign key in SQL

- A key used to link two tables together, refers to the primary key of another table


## What is a One-To-Many Relationship in SQL

## What is a Many-To-Many relationship in SQL

## What is a join in SQL

- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.



### What are the four DDL commands in SQL
- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP (Deletes the whole table from a database)
- TRUNCATE (Deletes the data inside the table but not the table itself)

## What are the four DML commands in SQL

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE (Deletes existing records in a table specified by a where clause)

## What is the difference between

## What is a junction table in SQL

- They contain the primary key columns of the two tables that we want to relate,





## What are the three forms of normality in SQL

- Normalisation is the process of organising/designing data in a database so that
it avoids redundancies of data (the same data is only stored in one place)


## 1st Normal forms

A database is in first normal form when the following conditions are satisfied:
- Data presented as small as it can be
- Value cannot be divided
- There should be no repeating groups

## 2nd Normal forms
-
-

## 3rd Normal Form

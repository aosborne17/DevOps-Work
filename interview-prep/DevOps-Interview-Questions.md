## What is DevOps

- A set of practices that combines the operations team and the development team, the aim
is to shorten the software lifecycle and provide Continuous delivery of a software
that is also of high quality

## How would a company benefit from implementing DevOps into their lifecycle

- Before Devops, the dev team would write all their weeks or months long code
merging it together, this would often lead to many failures and it was often difficult
to tell what component was causing it

- By shortening the time that code is integrated and tested, if there happens to
be a build failure, the team can quickly discover what code was causing it, and
thus speeding up the production time

- In addition to this when it came to giving the code to the Ops team, they would
often complain that the code doesn't work and the dev team would say it worked when
they ran it, thus this causes issues between the Two

- DevOps culture is about small teams working together under a shared responsibility
and team ethos


## What does it take to make a good DevOps Engineer

- Good attention to detail
- Strong communication to be able to effectively collaborate with the different teams
- Go the extra mile/be determined ~ As a DevOps Engineer you can't shortcut anything,
you must work to complete the product

## DevOps benefits

- The establishment of automated services means that ongoing operational costs are reduced
and in addition to this deployment time is also much faster

- Continuous Delivery to the customers can also allow greater feedback and thus changes
can be made more efficiently, increasing customer satisfaction

- RISK MITIGATION!!! ---> This is a big one for companies as they do not like risk
Continuous monitoring of code means that any problems can be quickly sorted out
before the issue becomes worse
In addition, using microservices architecture as opposed to Monolithic means that
we can move traffic to other servers if we have issues with some

## Challenges of implementing DevOps

- Transitioning takes a lot of time as it can often be hard to deal with legacy systems
and rebuild those applications to fit within a microservices

- In order to follow the DevOps culture, some job positions may need to be changed
and additional people hired, this could momentarily affect the work ethos

## What is Linux

- Linux is a free open-source operating system

## Why Do Many Companies choose to use Linux

- Almost all software's support Linux, and many are built off of Linux itself

- As mentioned, Linux is free to use and doesn't require any licensing to use

- The security aspect of linux is also very strong, due to it's open source nature
if there are any problems, bug fixes are released almost instantly


## What are the four DevOps Principles


#### Ease Of use

- Tools such as Ansible make provisioning files very easy and abstract the complexity
of tasks

-

#### Flexibility

- Based on client feedback we should be able to make changes to our software


#### Cost effective

- Due to automation, less manual power has to be spent provisioning things that would usually
take a long time

#### Robustness

- if something fails we can get it up and running quickly


## What is Continuous integration

## What is Continuous Delivery

## What is Jenkins

- Jenkins is an open source server that allows for automation of integrating Code
as well as testing it

- Jenkins itself is relatively lightweight however we can download github plugins
which would allow us to trigger jenkin builds whenever we push our code to a certain
branch (This is done using webhooks)


## What is Ansible

- An automation engine that automates cloud provisioning and configuration
management

- It frees up the time of manually configuring complicated tasks, instead freeing
up time for other tasks

- Very simple to use, we can provision multiple virtual machines using a single
playbook



## What is the difference between using docker or using a VM

-

## What is the difference between a webhook and an API

- A webhook listens out for responses, providing live data as it happens

- An API however allows apps to communication with each other but it must first
send a request to receive a response


## Explain Continuous integration in laymans terms

- So we can have multiple people trying to build one house at a time, each person is
trying to build a certain room of the house

- If everyone builds the whole room and then brings it together, we may find that
one door or one ceiling is too large and we would have to start again

- The point of CI is that we build parts of the room, then bring it all together and make sure
it all fits, if it does we can continue, if not then we would make some small changes
and try again

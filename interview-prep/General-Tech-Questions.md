## Why Tech

- Although it wasn't till the start of the year that I can began to look at programming or the means behind how computers run, I have always been fascinated in technology due to what is does for me on a daily basis

- It often astonishes me how tech has been able to bring all parts of the world together, being able to speak with people in your home country or in continents you've never been before all through the help of tech

- Even more so in the current circumstances that we are in, technology has been the backbone which has allowed businesses to keep working as effectively as possible

- Tech gives value to many people around the world who previously haven't had access to such things. This makes me want to work in tech because of the huge value it brings, being able to be on the forefront of new innovations that can help people it was fuels me to wake up and work hard

## Why have you chosen to do Devops

- I am incredibly passionate about technology and this would have lead me down a role such as software engineering or operating admin
however I'm all about the bigger picture. I want to be at the forefront when it comes to making decisions to improve the performance of a software and bring more value to the customers that benefit from our product and DevOps is a role that allows this.

- In addition DevOps allows me to bring out my interpersonal skills, explaining concepts to BA's and PM's as well as automating those repetitive manual tasks that will cut our errors
by 50% and containerisation our application and layering it that will reduce it's size by 80% are the main reasons why I gravitated to such a role

## How would you go about diagnosing and fixing a problem in DevOps

- Since I came across DevOps I have built up a large amount of knowledge on the tools I work with, if I come across an issue
on client site most likely I would be able to refer it to a previous problem that I have had and reverse engineer from there.

- In addition to this, DevOps is all about using technological tools to our advantage and using these to get some form of indication where the problem is coming from, for example tools such as CloudWatch or integration tests in Jenkins would help you understand where the issue is stemming from

- Lastly, being on the DevOps course has taught me that it's about knowing how to fix things and not remembering how to, if you are able to google effectively and have comprehensive
documentation of your previous projects, it will be much easier to find solutions to the errors you face

## How would you take a company's DevOps strategy to the next level

- I like to see myself as an innovate person that is always open to change and things haven't been any different during my time learning the concepts of DevOps,
I like to look at things commercially and I am flexible to take on new tasks or change the way we operate in order to better improve the performance of any organisation that I am working in

- I have a vast knowledge on many sectors and I can bring a lot to a company what other tech heavy Individuals cannot, from things such as Sales and hospitality, to science and healthcare, I understand what clients want and what they expect as I have seen this from many angles in my young career

- I'm a young individual and I understand that every methodology isn't final, looking back at the waterfall methodology and seeing how things can improve, I can't help but brainstorm how to improve software delivery even further in the near future

- To give you an example I was able to persuade my sales manager at my last job to adapt how we sold items in the store and the incentives that we gave customers, as a result of this we greatly improve our profit margins for that time

## Why Tech

- Although it wasn't till the start of the year that I can began to look at programming or the means behind how computers run, I have always been fascinated in technology due to what is does for me on a daily basis

- It often astonishes me how tech has been able to bring all parts of the world together, being able to speak with people in your home country or in continents you've never been before all through the help of tech

- Even more so in the current circumstances that we are in, technology has been the backbone which has allowed businesses to keep working as effectively as possible

- Tech gives value to many people around the world who previously haven't had access to such things. This makes me want to work in tech because of the huge value it brings, being able to be on the forefront of new innovations that can help people is what fuels me to wake up and work hard

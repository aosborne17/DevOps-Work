## What is a stakeholder

- An individual or group who is impacted by the outcome of a Project

There are two types of stakeholders:

- Internal stakeholders are people whose interest in a company comes through a
direct relationship, e.g. shareholders or employees

- External stakeholders do not directly work within the company but can still be
affected vicariously by the outcome, e.g. other organisations in the same sector
or the government

## Tell me about yourself?

- My name is Andrew and I am a recent graduate from the university of Portsmouth where I attained a first class honours in biomedical science,
since then I have decided to transition my skills into the tech industry and pursue my passion for tech and innovation

- I have recently enrolled in the amazing Sparta Global Academy where I have learnt many hard skills such as Python, SQL and CI tools but
more importantly I have learnt the importance of soft skills such as presentation skills and communication. It is substantially important if you
are able to explain concepts and proposals to PM 's and others of a lesser technological background. Listening is equally important, to be able to
actively listen to the demands of the client to be able to produce the best possible product in response to this, thus increasing customer satisfaction
which is what DevOps is all about

- I have a strong passion for fitness where it helps give structure to my day and allows me to keep physically and mentally fit, in addition to this I run a page where I help people
reach their fitness goals along with other ventures that make me an active member of my community

## Why did you choose Sparta when you decided to make the change to tech

- I have already done three years at university and most of my learning was all done statically and theoretically

- At Sparta, they work with the latest industry standard tools as well as shaping you to become the best possible consultant, I felt this was the best for my personal development


- I am a strong advocate for cohesion and diversity, these values are reflected within spartas ethos. The ability to work with such a company will be a motivating factor for myself

- Working with sparta will also give me the opportuinty to make a daily impact in societal issues such as mental health. I have seen that sparta has done work with CALM for the Speak Out Hackathon. In addition I have seen that sparta are heavily involved in CodeForGirls which I believe is a great scheme

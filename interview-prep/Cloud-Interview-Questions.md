## What is cloud computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet to offer
faster innovation


## What are the three models of Cloud computing

### SaaS

- Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet

- This is beneficial as it reduces the time and money spent on tasks such as installations

- Netflix and Facebook are both examples as SaaS

### PaaS

- This provides the complete development package for developers as the environment in
which the dev team work in has already been preconfigured

- PaaS is more like buying the car all put together with all the parts necessary to drive the car
and then just driving it

- As the ENV is preconfigured PaaS doesn't offer as much flexibility as IaaS

- Examples of PaaS include

### IaaS

- Referred to as a build it yourself approach, when we use IaaS tools such as AWS or Google cloud
we have access to many tools and resources to manage and develop our application

- Instead of buying the car, we get the pieces of the car and build it ourselves

- IaaS provides the resources needed for development but the organisation is responsible for provisioning
and managing the dev environment, for some organisations this will mean more flexibility for adding unique features
however this can be every time consuming as the developers have more work to do

- It is important to note that IaaS and PaaS can be used in conjunction, some organisations may employ PaaS for the frontend
aspects and IaaS for the backend functions



## How does IaaS differ to IaC


## What is Amazon Web services

- A cloud platform which provides cloud compute services

## What is an AMI

- An AMI is a template that provides the information required to launch an instance
- You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances
with the same configurations

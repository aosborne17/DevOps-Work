## What is Python

- Python is often described as a jack of all trades language as its potential applications can be seen far and wide in almost
all aspects of the tech sector, from machine learning, to Instagram to even being the backbone of many DevOps tools such as
Ansible

- In my most challenging but rewarding project I was able to create a user interface using the core concepts of OOP
as well as additional libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to create a Airport project in which the data was successfully stored
in a SQL database

- Additionally I have created A web application with user authentication which is stored in a database using the microframework flask,
this application was then deployed onto a virtual machine which was configured with the correct DEV environment to effectively run the application

## What is OOP

- OOP is the view everything as objects which can be instantiated through the use of classes. One of the main principles of OOP is Encapsulation so that everything an object needs will be inside the object

- OOP emphasizes reusability through inheritance and Polymorphism, keeping the changes to code minimal

- This is different to a functional programming language where the primary focus in on returning values from functions


## What are the four pillars of OOP

#### Encapsulation

- It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

#### Abstraction

- focuses on hiding the internal implemtations of a process or method from the user
- This is achieved in python through using abstract classes and interfaces

- An analogy would be where we click on a button to make coffee, we are unaware of the complexities


#### Inheritance

- In Python we can inherit from parent classes into child classes, this is helpful
where we want to create another class that has many of the same functionalities as another

- This allows for DRY code

- We will use the following

```Python
def __init__ (self, first_name, last_name, age, nationality, bank_sort_code, stream, sparta_rank):
  super().__init__(first_name, last_name, age, nationality, bank_sort_code)
```

- This means that we do not need to re initisialise the attributesas we have used the
super method


#### Polymorphism

- Poly means many and morph means forms

- Polymorphism works by Method overwritting and method overloading



#### Difference between unit testing and integrational testing

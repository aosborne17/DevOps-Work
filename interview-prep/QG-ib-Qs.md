Had to run commands individually

- The result of this was instantaneously configrations of my other virtual machines,
thus decreasing time taken and thus incrasing potential for scability as you can manage more VMs
at a time

- This leads to reduction in time, thus we can more rapidly test code changes, reduce human error
and get code infront of our clients and customers quicker and more effectively, thus increasing customer satisfaction through continuous question

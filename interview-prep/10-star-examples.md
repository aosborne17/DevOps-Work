##### Tell me a time when you implemented good Agile Practices

- During my 5th week on the course at Sparta we had to create an aeroplan project

- The team were tasked with creating a full fledged interface with a database which held persistent data

- I took responsibility with creating a trello board and breaking down the epic story into more mangeable user stories,
these user stories were then broken down into code snippets and tasks so we knew exactly what we had to do. In addition to this
we made sure that everyone knew what they were working with due to the Trello board, this also ensured people weren't doing the same job
- We also implemented daily standups and reviews so we knew exactly what stage everyone was at, this meant we may have had to work a little longer
after to ensure the sprint backlog was completed abd tasks didn't pile up into the next day

- As a result of these actions, it resulted in the project being completed successfully despite the limited time allocated to do such,
thus impressing our product manager who we presented the product to at weeks end

##### Tell me an occasion where you showed good communication skills

- S:

#### Tell me an occasion where you used leadership skills to complete a task

- S: Last year while working at Links Of London we had aims to increase our profit
margins by a large percentage based on the previous year

- T: We were tasked with increasing our sales over the Christmas period by 20% on the
previous fall during the two week Christmas period

- A: I took on the initiative to be active and implement some strategies in the store to make this possible,
these included suggesting different sales ideas to entice customers as well as changing the store layout
to make higher valued jewellery stand out. This was also coupled with the leading by example being more proactive when
talking to customers

- R: We always like to see some numbers which demonstrate the success of a project as they don't lie, our branch was able to
exceed the totals we were tasked with. In addition this greatly helped my interpersonal skills when it comes to communicating
with and influencing clients

#### Describe a time when you were under a lot of pressure at work. How did you react?

- S: Working as a recruitment associate at my previous internship we had to speak with a high client who was interested in
partnering with us,

- T: although I was already very busy with other workload I was assigned to speak with this client

- A: I knew I was put in a high pressure situation, I made myself completely available to the client and made sure I did extra work
where necessary to get over the required information

- R: As a result of my relentless hard efforts we were rewarded with the client signing with us and a huge increase in profits
